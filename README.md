# Nuxeo Perf App

> Tools to launch Performance Scenario on your Nuxeo Instance

## Building for production

Define your env variables

        String url = System.getenv("NUXEO_URL");
        String login = System.getenv("NUXEO_LOGIN");
        String password = System.getenv("NUXEO_PASSWORD");



## Using Docker

You can fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootWar -Pprod jibDockerBuild

Then run:

```bash

docker-compose up nuxeoperf-nuxeo

```

    #docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d


To optimize the nuxeoPerf application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootWar

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

**TODO** look at https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

Client tests:

    npm test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean test sonarqube
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootWar -Pprod jibDockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## More

This application was generated using JHipster 5.8.1, you can find documentation and help at [jhipster homepage and latest documentation][].

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
